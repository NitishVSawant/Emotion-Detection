# Emotion-Detection
Emotion Detection in a Dialogue using LSTMs

There are three jupyter notebooks namely 1_Data_Preparation.ipynb, 2_Modelling.ipynb and 3_Prediction.ipynb.

1_Data_Preparation.ipynb composes of EDA and Data Featurization

2_Modelling.ipynb composes of model training and evaluation

3_Prediction.ipynb generates predictions from the model for a dialogue.

utils consists of tokenizer and label index.

best_model1.h5 is the weights of trained model.

history1 consists of losses for each epoch for train and validation data.
